// sync_exec — carries out an order (SyncIntent) on the console through the
// service layer (core/pctl_ops.h), exactly as a press on the console would:
// every write goes through core_change_allowed() (read-only mode) and the
// play-timer gate; when the timer counts down, parental controls are
// unlocked for the write with the stored PIN and locked again right after,
// also when the write failed. Shared by the agent sysmodule and PlayGuard
// (which then records the change in its history from the outcome).
//
// What has to survive between runs (extra time to put back, the console
// lock's saved limits, an unlock not yet locked again) is in SyncRecords:
// the agent keeps it in sync/agent_state.txt, PlayGuard in config.json.
